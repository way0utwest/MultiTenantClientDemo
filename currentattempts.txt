Goal
- Have two databases, one that is "Shared" and one that is Client001.
- All code from Shared needs to be in Client001
- A project for Shared that has the objects for this db.
- A project for Client001 that only has objects for itself.

What I've tried
1. Created a SCA project for Shared
2. Created a filter for project Shared that excludes anything with "_Client001"
3. Created a dependent project for Client001 with a filter with include ends with "Client001"
4. Committed objects from Shared, setup Build, and Create Release - all working
5. Added Build for Client001, which is a single object. This error comes back

##[warning]	Copy: ERROR C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Microsoft.Common.targets(3540,5): Could not copy the file "E:\platoagent\_work\2\s\Code\ClientDemo_Shared\bin\Debug\" to the destination file "bin\Debug\", because the destination is a folder instead of a file. To copy the source file into a folder, consider using the DestinationFolder parameter instead of DestinationFiles.
